Assignment Write-up: AI-Generated Dashboard

Prompt Used:
"Create a professional React dashboard with TailwindCSS featuring a collapsible sidebar navigation, statistics cards showing key metrics (users, revenue, orders, conversion rate), and a data table with user management functionality including search and actions)."

Changes Made:
- Customized a brand-ready design system using HSL tokens and gradients
- Added collapsible sidebar with active route states
- Implemented statistics cards with icons and trend colors
- Built a searchable user table with actions menu
- Added routes for Users, Orders, Analytics, Revenue, Calendar, Billing, and Settings
- Ensured responsive layout and smooth animations

Challenges and Solutions:
- Ensuring consistent theming: centralized all tokens in index.css and tailwind.config.ts
- Route structure with shared layout: created a reusable DashboardLayout
- Keeping TypeScript strict: defined interfaces and used typed lucide icons

How to Run:
1) npm install
2) npm run dev

Notes:
This codebase is clean, responsive, and easy to brand by tweaking tokens in src/index.css.
